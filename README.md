Arduino
===================

Based on version 1.0.1 of @sundar's makefile for Arduino found at https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile.  

To build an Ardiono sketch, change to the sketch folder and run:

```bash
make && make upload
```

I installed Device::SerialPort on my machine (Mac OS 10.8) using system perl and:

```bash
cpan install Device::SerialPort
```
